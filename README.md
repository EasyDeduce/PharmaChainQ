## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Backend (API)

1. Open Terminal:  
   ```bash
   cd PharmaChainQ/backend
   npm install





Start the server:





node index.js



The backend will run on http://localhost:5000





✅ Frontend (React App)




Open another Terminal window:









npm start



The app will be available at http://localhost:3000





🧪 Testing


From the frontend directory:





npm test



Test coverage is provided for forms and components using Jest and React Testing Library.
